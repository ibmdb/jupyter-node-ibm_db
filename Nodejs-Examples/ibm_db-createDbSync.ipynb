#                                                                                              #
#  PURPOSE:  This program is designed to illustrate how to use the ibm_db.createDbSync() API   #
#            to create a database in an remote Db2 server.                                     #
#                                                                                              #
#            Additional APIs used:                                                             #
#                 ibm_db.openSync()                                                            #
#                 ibm_db.query()                                                               #
#                ibm_db.closeSync()                                                            #
#                                                                                              #
