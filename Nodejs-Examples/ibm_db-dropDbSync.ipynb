#  NAME:     ibm_db-dropDbSync.js                                                              #
#                                                                                              #
#  PURPOSE:  This program is designed to illustrate how to use the ibm_db.dropDbSync() API to  #
#            drop the database from an remote Db2 server.                                      #
#                                                                                              #
#            Additional APIs used:                                                             #
#                 ibm_db.openSync()                                                            #
#                 ibm_db.query()                                                               #
#                 ibm_db.closeSync()                                                           #
#                                                                                              #
