#  NAME:     ibm_db-executeSync.js                                                             #
#                                                                                              #
#  PURPOSE:  This program is designed to illustrate how to use the ibm_db.executeSync() API to #
#           execute a prepared statement from an remote Db2 server.                            #
#                                                                                              #
#            Additional APIs used:                                                             #
#                 ibm_db.open()                                                                #

#                 ibm_db.prepareSync()                                                         #
