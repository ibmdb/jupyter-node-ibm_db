#                                                                                              #
#  PURPOSE:  This program is designed to illustrate how to use the ibm_db.open() API to        #
#            asychronously establish a connection to a remote Db2 server.                      #
#                                                                                              #
#            Additional APIs used:                                                             #
#                 ibm_db.close()                                                               #
#                 ibm_db.query()                                                               #
#                                                                                              #
