#  NAME:     ibm_db-query.js                                                                   #
#                                                                                              #
#  PURPOSE:  This program is designed to illustrate how to use the ibm_db.query() API to       #
#            asynchronously fetch the record from a remote Db2 server.                         #
#                                                                                              #
#            Additional APIs used:                                                             #
#                 ibm_db.open()                                                                #
#                 ibm_db.close()                                                               #
#                                                                                              #
